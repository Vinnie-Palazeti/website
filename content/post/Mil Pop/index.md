I had the opportunity to research the City of Milwaukee's housing market. The Assessor's Office of Milwaukee provided the data. 

This was my first ever Map Visualization. It's a pretty wild start if you ask me. I wrote some python [code](https://github.com/Vinnie-Palazeti/Census/tree/main/CensusData) that queries the Census API. This data came from the American Community Survey (ACS) five year estimates.

The population stratification in Milwaukee is striking. These images are almost non-overlapping sets; it really blows my mind.

Just below the mid section, there is a circular area that is dark blue in both plots. This is where the Hispanic population lives.
