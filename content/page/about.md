My name is Vincenzo Palazeti. Most people call me Vinnie. I recently received a Masters in Applied Statistics from Loyola University Chicago. 

I'm interested in statistical inference, machine learning, & their intersection. Also, I enjoy geomap data visualizations, which I create with census data. 

This site is where I'll post the stuff I do.
